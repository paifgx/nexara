# Task ID: 24
# Title: Optimize App Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform performance optimization to meet the specified performance targets.
# Details:
Profile app startup time and optimize to under 2 seconds. Optimize notification scheduling to under 100ms. Improve check-in action performance to under 150ms. Implement lazy loading for heavy components. Optimize database queries. Reduce widget rebuilds with proper state management. Implement caching for expensive calculations. Optimize animations for smooth performance. Conduct memory leak detection.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark app startup time on various devices. Measure notification scheduling performance. Time check-in action completion. Profile memory usage during extended use. Test performance on low-end devices. Verify animations remain smooth under load.
