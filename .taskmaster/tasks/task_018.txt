# Title: Implement Data Export and Import
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to export and import app data in CSV and JSON formats.
# Details:
Implement data export to CSV format for spreadsheet analysis. Create JSON export for full backup including settings. Implement import functionality for previously exported files. Add file picker integration. Create progress UI for import/export operations. Implement validation of import files. Handle merge conflicts during import. Ensure exported files are properly formatted and include metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Test export to both CSV and JSON formats. Verify import works correctly with valid files. Test import validation rejects invalid files. Test with large datasets. Verify all data is correctly preserved during export/import cycle.
