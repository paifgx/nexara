# Description: Integrate error tracking and anonymous usage analytics for app improvement.
# Details:
Integrate Sentry for error tracking. Implement crash reporting. Create anonymous usage analytics. Add opt-out option for analytics. Implement proper error handling throughout the app. Create error boundary widgets. Add logging service. Ensure all tracking is privacy-preserving and transparent to users. Implement debug mode for development.

# Test Strategy:
Test error reporting with forced crashes. Verify opt-out works correctly. Test error boundaries contain crashes. Verify logs are properly captured. Test with analytics disabled. Ensure no personal data is included in error reports.
