# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main app shell with tab-based navigation for the five main sections: Today, Week, Plan, Texts, and Settings.
# Details:
Use go_router for navigation setup. Implement a bottom navigation bar with the five tabs. Create placeholder screens for each tab. Implement navigation state management with Riverpod. Ensure proper state preservation when switching between tabs. Add app bar with appropriate titles for each section. Implement basic transitions between tabs.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between all tabs. Verify state preservation when switching tabs. Test deep linking to specific tabs. Ensure accessibility navigation works correctly.
