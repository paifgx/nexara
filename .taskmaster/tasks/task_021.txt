# Title: Implement Supabase Integration for Cloud Sync
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up Supabase for optional cloud sync with authentication and data synchronization.
# Details:
Add Supabase dependencies. Implement magic link authentication. Set up Supabase database with proper schema. Configure Row-Level Security policies. Create device registry for multi-device sync. Implement two-way sync logic with conflict resolution. Create UI for enabling/disabling cloud sync. Implement background sync service. Ensure all sync is opt-in and privacy-preserving.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow. Verify data syncs correctly between devices. Test conflict resolution with simultaneous edits. Test offline behavior. Verify Row-Level Security prevents unauthorized access. Test sync with large datasets.
