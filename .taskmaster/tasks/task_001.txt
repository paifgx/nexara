# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial Flutter project with Material Design 3 theming and necessary configurations.
# Details:
Create a new Flutter project using the latest stable Flutter version. Configure the pubspec.yaml with initial dependencies including riverpod for state management and go_router for navigation. Set up the Material 3 theming system with light/dark mode support and configurable accent colors. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore file. Create the basic folder structure following clean architecture principles with UI, domain, and data layers.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Test theme switching between light and dark mode. Ensure Material 3 components render correctly on different screen sizes.
